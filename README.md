[MathCalculators]
{Developed by Beyond Reality}
The Math Calculators are good tools if you're trying to cheat at your next Math exam...
No just kidding.
But they are really usefull for basic and advanced Mathematical Calculations
They 'should' have every function a normal calculator has got!

[WhichVersionIsBestToUse]
There are 3 Versions of the Calculators here sorted in folders.
  
  [CppMath]
  In this folder you'll find the C++ version of the Calculators (C++ is a 
                                                                 Programming language
                                                                 if you didn't know)
  Pros => 1. C++ is a very powerfull and organized language
             means that this version will be very stable, fast and reliable

  Cons => 1. C++ is not platform-independent, that means that you can only run
             it on windows!
          2. It's design is not that good

  How to run => Just click on the .exe (Executable) and there you go!

  [C#Math]
  In this folder you'll find the C# version of the Calculators

  Pros => 1. C# is platform-independent which means you can run it on every PC

  Cons => 1. C# is not at all that powerfull and organized as C++
             means that it will be not that good in things performance
          2. it's design is also not very good

  How to run => Find the .exe in the folder and run it (DON'T DELETE ANYTHING ELSE IN THERE!)

  [JavMath]
  This one is the Java edition for the calculators

  Pros => 1. Java is also Platform-independent just like C#!
          2. It has the best design

  Cons => 1. Java is at least more powerfull than C# (in my opinion)
             but it still won't reach the performance of C++

  How to run => Normally you should be able to click the .exe and run it

  IF it won't work => Look if you have Java installed (The Jre1.8.0 and the Jdk-22)
                      it should be somewhere in >C:/Program Files/Java<

                      IF you don't have Java installed head to
                      this(https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) site and
                      download Java-22 for your System

  IF you aren't able to run it even with Java installed => this is very unlikely but can happen
                                                           so just go into the BACKUP folder in the
                                                           JavMath folder and launch the jar file
                                                           (it is executable with java installed)
